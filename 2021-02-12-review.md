# **Intro**

The “Civil War Washington” project details the history behind the impact of the Civil War on Washington D.C. It specifically touches on the social, political, medical/scientific changes that were brought to the city due to the war. It draws on essays, conference papers, grant narratives, and other various sources in order to accurately teach the importance of the historical event.



# **Navigation**

The blog is easy to navigate, with information presented concisely. The first page contains photos that can be clicked on. These photos will direct to various pages titles: 
Introductions 
Data
Maps
Texts
Visual Works
Interpretations
When hovered over with the mouse, each photo lights up, alerting you to the fact that it is ready to be clicked on. At the top of the page there is an overview of the project’s contents. There is a “more” option that can be clicked, which then takes you to a new page instead of expanding the content on the current one. On the new page, all of the same information that was on the first page remains, but it is displayed in a new format. So essentially, both the homepage and the page that you are directed to after clicking the more option in the summary contain all of the same info. Clicking the “more” link in the summary, and clicking the “Introduction” link just below it will take you to the same page.


# **Contents**

Each link on the page takes you to a different page that involves specific information regarding the topic that was chosen. Under each link is a brief summary regarding the contents of the link, making the user aware of what they are about to read/ see before they click on it. All of the links take the user to a new page with a brief summary of the new page’s contents at the very top. There is the first link which is titled “Introductions,” and it includes information that introduces people to the topic that are unfamiliar with it. The next link is titled “Data,” and it has clickable links to people, places, events, organizations, and documents that were involved in the events of the time. All of these links lead to charts that provide more information. There is also the option to download the data if you would like. The next link is titled “Maps,” and it takes you to an interactive map with specific instructions on how to work it. 

# **Header**

CWW presents the information on its page in a straightforward manner. Everything has its own place and none of the summaries are too long or confusing. The one thing about the blog that could cause some confusion is the more button located on the home page. Instead of expanding the information on the home page, the more button at the bottom of the paragraph

# **Review**

CWW offers a wide variety of information regarding the Civil War’s effect on Washington D.C. When referring to the About link at the bottom of the page, you are directed to a summary of CWW’s topics. The information that was presented here does not exactly match the header that it is placed under, however the information provided is still useful to the project overall.
