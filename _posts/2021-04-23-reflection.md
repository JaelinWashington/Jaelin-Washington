**A Good Man is Hard to Find**

For my project I plan to create a visual/ interactive mapping project for the short story “A Good Man is Hard to Find” by Flannery O’Connor. I had to read the story for a course that I took over the summer, and it was then that I realized the complexity of it. I expected my other professors to teach the story over time, but when that did not happen, I thought that using it for this project would be a nice way to show, even to a few people, how great this story is.
I decided to use this story for this particular project because one, I really enjoyed reading it, and two, I believed that a visual narrative for it would be very helpful to anyone who studies it. When I first read this story, the family’s journey, and eventual crash, confused me a bit. I am personally a visual learner, and I believe that texts like this one rely heavily on the reader’s ability to visualize settings and environments easily. However, there are those of us who cannot easily imagine settings without some sort of visual aid, and that is what I hope my project can act as. I believe that this project would be helpful to any teacher or professor who decided to use this story in a class, and I think it will make for a smoother read overall.

I have taken tips from the website Esri: The Science of Where. The website has a section specifically for “Story Maps and the Digital Humanities,” and it showcases several other DH mapping projects created by various “students, academics, archivists, museum curators, and the wider storytelling community.”

The closest example to what I am planning for my project was the one titled “Aeneid: An Interactive Voyage.” It takes the visitor through the journey from the epic poem using both images and a map to guide you. On the left side of the images and descriptions is the navigation, which allows you to move to any spot on the map that you would like. This project, while it is not using “A Good Man is Hard to Find,” it is very similar to what I am hoping to achieve with my grant project.

**My Digital Humanities Experience**

My understanding of Digital Humanities, as a whole, has changed over the past semester. Before this semester began, I had no idea what the term meant, despite the fact that it was used often in my other courses. However, it was actually this project that helped me understand the actual meaning of DH a little bit better. Within Esri, the same website that I referenced earlier, DH is defined as the “application of computer technology to explore issues and questions in the humanities.” I am honestly still a bit foggy regarding the idea of the “humanities,” because I have struggled to find a concrete definition of the term, but my understanding of the “digital” aspect has improved quite a bit since the beginning of the semester. 
The project that I struggled with the most was probably the first blog post, since I had never coded at that level before. I struggled especially with adding the photos, but after meeting with Dr. Stover about it I was able to figure it out. Overall, this course has expanded my knowledge on a topic that I previously had absolutely no knowledge of. I have never had to write in the informative sense that we focused on in this course, and it was a welcome change after writing the same kinds of paper for three years.
